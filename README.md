Q11 If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method ad Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company approriately spent shipping costs based on the priority? Explain answer. 
```sql
SELECT 
    Order_Priority,
    Ship_Mode,
    sum(Shipping_Cost)  AS Total_shipping_cost_for_priority,
    count(Order_ID) AS number_of_shipping_cost_for_priority_ship_mode
FROM 
    [KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY 
    Order_Priority, Ship_Mode
ORDER BY 
    Order_Priority, Total_shipping_cost_for_priority Desc;
```
|Order-Priority|Ship_Mode|Total_Shipping_Cost_For_Prority|Number_Of_Shipping_Cost_For_Priority_Ship_Mode|
|---------|-------|--------|--------|
|Critical|Delivery Truck|10,783.820|228|
|Critical|Regular Air|8,586.760|1180|
|Critical|Express Air|1,742.100|200|
|High|Delivery Truck|11,206.880|248|
|High|Regular Air|10,005.010|1308|
|High|Express Air|1,453.530|212|
|Low|Delivery Truck|11,131.610|250|
|Low|Regular Air|10,263.620|1280|
|Low|Express Air|1,551.630|190|
|Medium|Delivery Truck|9,461.630|205|
|Medium|Regular Air|9,418.720|1225|
|Medium|Express Air|1,633.590|201|
|Not Specified|Regular Air|9,734.080|1277|
|Not Specified|Delivery Truck|9,388.010|215|
|Not Specified|Express Air|1,470.060|180|

* Recommendation 

After analyzing the data, I discovered that high-cost shipping methods (e.g., Express Air) were frequently used for low-priority orders, while high-priority orders were more associated with delivery by Truck (resulting in delayed delivery despite urgency). This suggests inefficiency in operations or poor logistics/planning.
+ Recommendations 
- Implement a layered shipping guideline that aligns delivery mode with order priority.
- Introducing checks or an approval process for expensive methods can reduce unnecessary spending.
